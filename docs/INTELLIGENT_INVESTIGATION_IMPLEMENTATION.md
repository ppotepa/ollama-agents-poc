We have successfully implemented a comprehensive intelligent investigation system that enables dynamic model switching, task decomposition, execution planning, self-reflection, and adaptive investigation strategies. This system represents a significant advancement in automated AI agent orchestration.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### 1. Task Decomposer (`src/core/task_decomposer.py`)
**Purpose**: Break complex queries into manageable subtasks with optimal model assignments.

- **Model Preferences**: Automatically assigns optimal models based on task type
- **Complexity Estimation**: Provides complexity scores for resource planning
- **Dependency Management**: Tracks inter-task dependencies

**Example Output**:
```
Query: "Analyze the codebase structure and find any potential bugs"
‚Üí 3 subtasks generated:
  1. Gather relevant context (FILE_ANALYSIS) ‚Üí deepcoder:14b
  2. Scan directory structure (FILE_ANALYSIS) ‚Üí deepcoder:14b  
  3. Analyze file content (FILE_ANALYSIS) ‚Üí deepcoder:14b
```

### 2. Execution Planner (`src/core/execution_planner.py`)
**Purpose**: Create optimized execution plans with model assignments and dependency resolution.

**Key Features**:
- **Model Selection**: AgentResolver integration for optimal model matching

- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, speed, reliability, user feedback
- **Automatic Triggers**: Step completion, errors, low confidence, timeouts
- **Model Recommendations**: Intelligent suggestions for model swaps
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Actionable recommendations for optimization

**Reflection Triggers**:
- After each step completion

- On user request or timeout

### 4. Context Manager (`src/core/context_manager.py`)
**Purpose**: Persistent state management across model swaps and investigation sessions.

**Key Features**:
- **Session Management**: Persistent contexts with unique session IDs
- **State Transfer**: Seamless context transfer between model swaps
- **Execution History**: Complete audit trail of all operations
- **Data Persistence**: Optional file-based persistence for long sessions

**Context Types**:
- Execution history and results
- Discovered files and analysis
- Error states and resolutions
- Progress tracking and metrics

### 5. Investigation Strategies (`src/core/investigation_strategies.py`)
**Purpose**: Different exploration patterns optimized for various query types.

**Implemented Strategies**:

#### **Depth-First Strategy**
- Dives deep into specific areas
- Ideal for: debugging, detailed analysis, focused implementation
- Creates specialized investigation steps for code, files, implementation, or debugging

#### **Breadth-First Strategy**
- Explores all areas broadly first
- Ideal for: overviews, comprehensive analysis, discovery
- Creates overview steps followed by area-specific investigations

#### **Targeted Strategy**
- Focuses on specific objectives
- Ideal for: specific files, functions, targeted fixes
- Extracts targets from queries and creates focused investigation plans

**Strategy Selection Logic**:
- "specific", "particular" ‚Üí Targeted
- "overview", "summary", "all" ‚Üí Breadth-First
- "deep", "detailed", "thorough" ‚Üí Depth-First
- Default: Breadth-First

### 6. Intelligent Orchestrator (`src/core/intelligent_orchestrator.py`)
**Purpose**: Central coordination layer that integrates all components.

**Orchestration Process**:

1. **Planning Phase**:
   - Task decomposition using TaskDecomposer
   - Strategy selection via InvestigationStrategyManager
   - Execution plan creation combining investigation + decomposition

2. **Execution Phase**:
   - Step execution with assigned models
   - Real-time context management
   - Streaming or non-streaming execution modes

3. **Reflection Phase**:
   - Performance evaluation after each step
   - Model swap recommendations
   - Plan adaptation based on results

4. **Adaptation Phase**:
   - Dynamic plan modification
   - Strategy switching when needed
   - Context optimization

**Execution Modes**:
- **Sequential**: One step at a time with full reflection
- **Parallel**: Multiple independent steps concurrently
- **Adaptive**: Dynamic switching based on performance
- **Smart Routing**: Optimal model routing to minimize switches
