# Collaborative System Improvements

This document describes the comprehensive improvements made to fix the issues identified in the collaborative system analysis.

## Issues Identified

Based on the analysis of the last run, the following issues were identified:

1. **Context Loss During Agent Switching**: The valuable output from `list_files_recurse` (79,579 characters) was lost when switching from "universal" to "qwen2.5-coder:7b" agent.

2. **Agent Executor Errors**: Error building agent executor: `'list' object has no attribute 'get'` which limited tool functionality.

3. **Repetitive Tool Execution**: The agent got stuck reading the same compiled Python file multiple times instead of exploring other files.

4. **Model Not Found Errors**: The "universal" model doesn't exist in Ollama, causing initial failures.

5. **Ineffective Use of Comprehensive File Listings**: The system didn't effectively utilize the comprehensive results from `list_files_recurse`.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Context Preservation During Agent Switching

**File**: `src/core/collaborative_system.py`

- **Enhanced `_switch_main_agent` method**: Now creates a context summary before switching agents
- **New `_create_context_summary` method**: Preserves discovered files, executed commands, and key results
- **Context Transfer**: Attempts to provide context to new agents if they support it

**Key Features**:
- Preserves up to 50 most relevant files from `list_files_recurse` results
- Prioritizes important files (main.py, README, config files)
- Includes execution history and intermediate results
- Provides truncated previews of large results

### 2. Improved Model Name Resolution

**File**: `src/core/collaborative_fixes.py`

- **Agent Name Mapping**: Maps problematic agent names like "universal" to real models
- **Model Existence Verification**: Checks if models exist before using them
- **Reliable Fallbacks**: Uses known-good models when specified models fail

**Default Mappings**:
- `universal` â†’ `qwen2.5-coder:7b`
- `default` â†’ `qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M`
- `unknown` â†’ `qwen2.5-coder:7b`

### 3. Prevention of Repetitive Tool Execution

**File**: `src/core/collaborative_system.py`

- **Enhanced `_determine_command_args` method**: Tracks previously read files
- **Smart File Selection**: Avoids reading the same files repeatedly
- **Priority-based Selection**: Prefers important unread files over previously analyzed ones

**Features**:
- Maintains set of already-read files
- Prioritizes Python source files over compiled bytecode
- Focuses on configuration and documentation files
- Provides intelligent fallbacks when all important files are read

### 4. Tool Registry Improvements

**File**: `src/core/tool_fixes.py`

- **Enhanced Tool Registration**: Validates tool format before registration
- **Safe Agent Executor Creation**: Handles tool loading errors gracefully
- **Fallback to LLM-only Mode**: Continues operation even when tools fail

**Key Improvements**:
- Validates tools have required `name` and `description` attributes
- Provides fallback tool creation methods
- Enables graceful degradation when tool systems fail

### 5. Better Utilization of Comprehensive File Listings

**File**: `src/core/collaborative_system.py`

- **Enhanced `ask_interceptor_for_next_steps` method**: Detects when comprehensive listings are available
- **Smart Recommendation Logic**: Prioritizes file analysis over exploration when comprehensive data exists
- **Context-aware Decision Making**: Uses file listing size and content to guide recommendations

**Features**:
- Detects `list_files_recurse` results larger than 10KB as "comprehensive"
- Shifts focus from exploration to analysis when comprehensive data exists
- Provides samples of comprehensive listings to the interceptor for context

### 6. System-wide Improvements Integration

**File**: `src/core/system_improvements.py`

- **Master Coordination**: Applies all improvements in the correct order
- **Environment Configuration**: Sets flags for improved behaviors
- **Status Monitoring**: Tracks which improvements were successfully applied

**Auto-applied Improvements**:
- Collaborative error recovery
- Context preservation during switching
- Smart file selection
- Enhanced investigation mode (if available)

## Environment Variables

The improvements use several environment variables to control behavior:

- `COLLABORATIVE_ERROR_RECOVERY=1`: Enables enhanced error recovery
- `PRESERVE_CONTEXT_ON_SWITCH=1`: Enables context preservation during agent switching
- `SMART_FILE_SELECTION=1`: Enables intelligent file selection logic
- `USE_ENHANCED_INVESTIGATION=1`: Enables enhanced investigation mode
- `DISABLE_AUTO_IMPROVEMENTS=1`: Disables automatic application of improvements

## Usage

The improvements are automatically applied when the system starts. You can see the status in the console output:

```
ðŸ”§ System improvements: 5/5 applied successfully
```

### Manual Application

If needed, you can manually apply improvements:

```python
from src.core.system_improvements import apply_all_improvements
results = apply_all_improvements()
```

### Check Status

To check which improvements are active:

```python
from src.core.system_improvements import get_improvement_status
status = get_improvement_status()
print(status)
```

## Expected Results

After applying these improvements, the collaborative system should:

1. **Preserve Context**: Important information from `list_files_recurse` and other commands is preserved when switching agents
2. **Avoid Model Errors**: Uses reliable, existing models instead of non-existent ones like "universal"
3. **Smart File Exploration**: Efficiently explores files without getting stuck on the same files
4. **Better Tool Support**: Handles tool loading errors gracefully and provides fallbacks
5. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Effectively uses comprehensive file listings to guide analysis

## Testing

To test the improvements, run a repository analysis:

```bash
python main.py --intelligent -q "analyze this repository and tell me what it does" -g https://github.com/ppotepa/ollama.git -fa
```

You should observe:
- No "universal model not found" errors
- Effective use of `list_files_recurse` results
- No repetitive reading of the same files
- Smooth agent transitions with preserved context
- More comprehensive and accurate analysis results

## Rollback

If issues occur, you can disable the improvements:

```bash
DISABLE_AUTO_IMPROVEMENTS=1 python main.py --intelligent -q "your query here"
```

This will run the system with the original behavior.
