# Query Logging System Implementation Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive query logging system that categorizes logs for each query and creates accumulated logs of execution context, prompt decorations, and execution tree development.

## 🎯 **What Was Requested**

> "ok we would like to categorize our logs for each query and create accumulated log of what happened
> what context have been used, what were decorated prompt looking like
> and how context worked and execution tree developed"

## ✅ **What Was Delivered**

### 1. **Categorized Query Logs**
- ✅ Each query gets a unique ID (e.g., `2e700cb7`, `bfea2e03`)
- ✅ Logs are categorized by execution mode (`manual_test`, `integration_test`, `collaborative`, etc.)
- ✅ Structured JSON format for easy analysis and processing
- ✅ Time-stamped entries with complete execution tracking

### 2. **Context Usage Tracking**
```json
{
  "source": "user_request",
  "content": "write a Python function to calculate factorial",
  "size_chars": 52,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-26T15:12:43.123456",
  "metadata": {
    "task_type": "coding",
    "complexity": "medium"
  }
}
```

**Context Sources Tracked:**
- ✅ `user_input` - Original user queries
- ✅ `system_knowledge` - System-provided context
- ✅ `task_analysis` - Task type analysis results
- ✅ `tool_output` - Results from tool executions
- ✅ `agent_switch` - Context preserved during model switches
- ✅ `file_content` - Content from files read during execution

### 3. **Decorated Prompt Tracking**
```json
{
  "original_prompt": "write a Python function to calculate factorial",
  "decorated_prompt": "You are an expert Python programmer. Please provide a complete solution.\n\nUser request: write a Python function to calculate factorial\n\nPlease include:\n1. Complete implementation\n2. Error handling\n3. Example usage",
  "decorations_applied": [
    "system_message",
    "instruction_enhancement", 
    "format_specification"
  ],
  "context_added": 187,
  "system_message": "You are an expert Python programmer.",
  "prompt_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
}
```

**Decoration Types Tracked:**
- ✅ `system_message` - System role/personality prompts
- ✅ `instruction_enhancement` - Additional instructions
- ✅ `format_specification` - Output format requirements
- ✅ `context_injection` - Injected contextual information
- ✅ `tool_guidance` - Tool usage instructions

### 4. **Execution Tree Development**
```
🌳 Execution Tree for Query: bfea2e03
📝 Original Query: write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number
🕐 Duration: 0.10s

📍 Step 1: universal_agent_processing
   🤖 Agent: qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M
   📄 Description: Processing request with Universal Multi-Agent
   🔧 Tools executed:
      ✅ code_generator (0.100s)
   📊 Context used: 161 chars from 2 sources
```

**Tree Elements Tracked:**
- ✅ **Steps**: Individual execution phases with descriptions
- ✅ **Agent Usage**: Which models were used at each step
- ✅ **Tool Executions**: What tools were called and their results
- ✅ **Agent Switches**: Model changes during execution
- ✅ **Context Evolution**: How context grew and changed
- ✅ **Timing Information**: Execution duration for each component

### 5. **Accumulated Analytics**
```
