# Universal Multi-Agent System Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully replaced the problematic "universal" agent with a proper Universal Multi-Agent system that can dynamically switch between multiple models based on task requirements.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Universal Multi-Agent (`src/core/universal_multi_agent.py`)
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Automatically analyzes task requirements and selects the optimal model
- **Task Type Recognition**: Identifies coding, analysis, creative, research, documentation, and general tasks
- **Model Capability Mapping**: Each model has defined strengths and performance scores
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains execution history and task context across model switches
- **Manual Override**: Allows forced switching to specific models when needed

### 2. Available Models and Their Capabilities
```python
AVAILABLE_MODELS = {
    "qwen2.5-coder:7b": {
        "strengths": ["programming", "code_review", "debugging", "software_architecture"],
        "task_types": [TaskType.CODING, TaskType.DEBUGGING, TaskType.DOCUMENTATION],
        "performance_score": 8.5
    },
    "deepcoder:14b": {
        "strengths": ["advanced_coding", "complex_algorithms", "system_design", "refactoring"],
        "task_types": [TaskType.CODING, TaskType.DEBUGGING, TaskType.ANALYSIS],
        "performance_score": 9.2
    },
    "qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M": {
        "strengths": ["analysis", "instruction_following", "reasoning", "problem_solving"],
        "task_types": [TaskType.ANALYSIS, TaskType.GENERAL, TaskType.RESEARCH],
        "performance_score": 8.7
    },
    # ... and 3 more models
}
```

### 3. Integration with Existing System
- **Agent Factory Integration**: The Universal Multi-Agent is created when `model_id` is "universal" or "universal-multi"
- **Collaborative System Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with the existing collaborative execution system
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains state during agent switching with 1000+ character summaries
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles model unavailability with reliable fallbacks

## How It Works

### Task Analysis
The system analyzes incoming prompts for keywords that indicate task type:
- **Coding**: "code", "function", "debug", "programming", "python", etc.
- **Analysis**: "analyze", "explain", "compare", "evaluate", "assess", etc.
- **Creative**: "write", "story", "creative", "imagine", "design", etc.
- **Research**: "research", "find", "search", "learn", "study", etc.

### Model Selection Process
1. **Analyze Task**: Determine primary task type from prompt
2. **Filter Models**: Find models capable of handling the task type
3. **Score Models**: Rank by performance score and task-specific strengths
4. **Resource Check**: Consider model size constraints if specified
5. **Switch if Needed**: Only switch if a significantly better model is available

### Example Usage
```python
from src.core.universal_multi_agent import create_universal_multi_agent

# Create the agent
agent = create_universal_multi_agent()

# It automatically selects the best model for each task
response = agent.process_request("Write a Python function to sort a list")
# → Automatically switches to qwen2.5-coder:7b or deepcoder:14b

response = agent.process_request("Analyze this dataset for patterns")
# → Automatically switches to qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M

response = agent.process_request("Write a creative story about space")
# → Automatically switches to gemma:7b-instruct-q4_K_M
```

## Testing Results

The system was successfully tested with:
- ✅ Task analysis and model recommendation
- ✅ Automatic model switching based on task type
- ✅ Manual model switching with force override
- ✅ Integration with collaborative execution system
- ✅ Context preservation during agent transitions
- ✅ Real coding task execution (Fibonacci function generation)

## Performance Improvements

### Before (Old "Universal" Agent)
- ❌ Tried to use "universal" as a model name (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Constant model resolution failures
- ❌ Poor task-model matching
- ❌ Fixed single model approach

### After (Universal Multi-Agent)
- ✅ Dynamic model selection based on task analysis
- ✅ Intelligent task-to-model matching
- ✅ Context preservation across switches
- ✅ Fallback handling for unavailable models
- ✅ Performance scoring for optimal selection

## System Integration

The Universal Multi-Agent is now integrated into:
1. **Agent Factory** (`src/core/agent_factory.py`) - Creates Universal Multi-Agent for "universal" requests
2. **Collaborative Fixes** (`src/core/collaborative_fixes.py`) - Handles "universal" agent mapping
3. **System Improvements** (`src/core/system_improvements.py`) - Validates Universal Multi-Agent availability
4. **Main Application** - Works seamlessly with `--intelligent` mode

## Benefits

1. **No More "Universal" Model Errors**: The system no longer tries to use non-existent "universal" model
2. **Intelligent Model Selection**: Tasks are automatically matched with the most suitable models
3. **Better Performance**: Each task gets executed by the model best suited for it
4. **Seamless Switching**: Model changes are transparent to the user
5. **Context Preservation**: Important information is maintained across model switches
6. **Resource Efficiency**: Only switches models when there's a clear benefit

## Conclusion

The Universal Multi-Agent system successfully resolves the original issue where the system was "constantly choosing wrong models" by implementing intelligent, task-aware model selection. This provides a much better user experience and more accurate results across different types of tasks.
