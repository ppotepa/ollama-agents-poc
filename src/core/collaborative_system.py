# module.  In the refactored system collaborative execution is handled by
# higher-level strategies and orchestrators.  To avoid import errors and
# provide a minimal fallback we implement a simple wrapper here.  The
# function delegates to ``CollaborativeAgentSystem.collaborative_execution``
# when possible and returns a basic result structure.

## Core Architecture Patterns

1. **Clean Architecture**
   - Organize code in concentric layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation
   - Dependencies point inward, with domain at the center
   - Use interfaces to enforce the Dependency Inversion Principle

2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Split functionality into independently deployable services
   - Use ASP.NET Core for lightweight, cross-platform services
   - Implement service discovery and API gateways

3. **Modular Monolith**
   - Organize as modules with clear boundaries but deploy as single application
   - Use feature folders rather than technical folders
   - Clearly define public APIs between modules

## Key C# Technologies & Practices

1. **Dependency Injection**
   - Use Microsoft's built-in DI container or Autofac for more advanced scenarios
   - Register services by interface, not concrete implementation
   - Use scoped lifetimes appropriately (Singleton, Scoped, Transient)

2. **CQRS Pattern**
   - Separate command and query responsibilities
   - Use MediatR library to implement handlers
   - Consider different data models for reads vs. writes

3. **Modularization Techniques**
   - Use assembly-level modularity with separate projects
   - Consider dynamic loading of modules at runtime
   - Implement mediator pattern for cross-module communication

4. **Domain-Driven Design**
   - Model rich domain entities with behavior
   - Use value objects for immutable concepts
   - Implement aggregates and aggregate roots

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Project Structure**
   - Use solution folders to organize related projects
   - Consider a shared kernel for cross-cutting concerns
   - Keep libraries focused and cohesive

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test domain logic thoroughly
   - Use integration tests for infrastructure components
   - Implement end-to-end tests sparingly for critical paths

3. **Deployment Considerations**
   - Use containerization with Docker
   - Consider Azure App Service for simpler deployments
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps

## Core Principles

1. **High Cohesion, Low Coupling**
   - Group related functionality together
   - Minimize dependencies between modules
   - Define clean interfaces between components

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each module should have a single responsibility
   - Isolate business logic from infrastructure concerns
   - Use layered architecture patterns

3. **Dependency Inversion**
   - Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
   - Use interfaces and dependency injection
   - Implement plugins and extension points

4. **Scalable Design Patterns**
   - Consider microservices for highly scalable systems
   - Use event-driven architecture for loosely coupled systems
   - Implement CQRS for complex domains with heavy reads/writes

## Implementation Strategies

1. **Module Boundaries**
   - Define explicit public APIs for each module
   - Encapsulate implementation details
   - Consider physical separation (separate projects/packages)

2. **Communication Patterns**
   - Use events for asynchronous communication
   - Implement command pattern for operations
   - Consider mediator pattern for cross-module coordination

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit test modules in isolation
   - Use integration tests for module interactions
   - Implement contract tests between modules

4. **Deployment Options**
   - Deploy as single application with logical modules
   - Use microservices for independent deployment
   - Consider serverless for event-driven components
