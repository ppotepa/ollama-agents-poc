"""Modular Intelligent Orchestrator - Coordinates investigation with model switching.

This module provides simplified stubs for the intelligent orchestrator components.  The
full implementation of an adaptive, multi-model orchestrator can be quite
complex and depends on many other modules (execution planning, model
selection, etc.).  During the refactoring to a clean architecture the
original implementation was not fully migrated, leading to missing types
such as :class:`ExecutionStep` and :class:`OrchestrationSession`.  To
maintain backwards compatibility and avoid import errors for modules that
depend on these names (e.g. the intelligence enhancer and logging
patches), this file defines minimal placeholder classes along with a basic
`IntelligentOrchestrator` implementation.  These stubs are sufficient for
enabling the CLI and other components to run without crashing, while
leaving room for future expansion with a proper orchestrator.
