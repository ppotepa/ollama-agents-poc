"""Infrastructure layer package for Generic Ollama Agent.

The infrastructure layer contains concrete implementations of external
dependencies such as model integrations, repository analyzers, configuration
parsing, tools and utility functions. Code in this layer should be the only
place that performs IO operations or interacts with external systems. The
application and domain layers depend on these abstractions via defined
interfaces rather than referring to them directly.
