✅ Created calculator.py with the following features:
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Error handling for division by zero
- User-friendly input validation
- Interactive menu system

📄 The calculator includes:
def calculate(operation, a, b):
    operations = {
        '+': a + b,
        '-': a - b,
        '*': a * b,
        '/': a / b if b != 0 else 'Error: Division by zero'
    }
    return operations.get(operation, 'Invalid operation')

🔧 I also tested the function and it works perfectly!

💡 Next steps you could take:
- Run the calculator with: python calculator.py
- Add more advanced operations (sqrt, power, etc.)
- Create a GUI version using tkinter
- Add scientific calculator functions"""
