OLLAMA AGENT SYSTEM - COMPREHENSIVE FIX SUMMARY
==============================================

All critical issues have been successfully resolved:

✅ ISSUE 1: CHARACTER DUPLICATION IN STREAMING OUTPUT
-----------------------------------------------------
Problem: Duplicate characters appeared in agent streaming output
Root Cause: Multiple calls to stream_text() in agent initialization
Solution: Replaced stream_text() calls with direct print() statements with flush=True
Files Modified: 
- src/agents/universal/agent.py

✅ ISSUE 2: CAPABILITY FORMAT HANDLING ERROR
-------------------------------------------
Problem: "'list' object has no attribute 'get'" errors
Root Cause: Inconsistent capability data formats (list vs dictionary)
Solution: Made capability property methods format-agnostic
Files Modified:
- src/integrations/model_config_reader.py
- src/core/model_capability_checker.py

✅ ISSUE 3: MODEL EXISTENCE VERIFICATION & AUTO-PULLING
-----------------------------------------------------
Problem: Models recommended by capability checker don't exist, causing failures
Root Cause: No verification of model availability before assignment
Solution: Added model existence checking and auto-pulling with fallback logic
Files Modified:
- src/core/model_discovery.py (added model_exists() and helper functions)
- src/core/model_capability_checker.py (added get_default_model() method)
- src/core/intelligent_orchestrator.py (added model existence checks and fallback)

✅ ISSUE 4: CHARACTER ENCODING IN MODEL PULLING (BONUS FIX)
----------------------------------------------------------
Problem: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte errors during model pulling on Windows
Root Cause: subprocess calls without proper UTF-8 encoding configuration
Solution: Added explicit UTF-8 encoding with error handling to all subprocess calls
Files Modified:
- src/core/model_discovery.py
- src/core/model_downloader.py
- src/integrations/ollama_integration.py
- src/core/helpers.py

TESTING RESULTS:
================
✅ Model Existence Tests: PASSED
✅ Capability Format Handling Tests: PASSED  
✅ Streaming Agent Tests: PASSED
✅ Model Fallback Tests: PASSED
✅ Character Encoding Tests: PASSED

VERIFICATION:
=============
1. Character duplication: Fixed by updating streaming output mechanism
2. Capability errors: Fixed by making all capability checks format-agnostic
3. Model existence: Fixed with robust existence checking and fallback logic
4. Encoding issues: Fixed with proper UTF-8 handling in all subprocess calls

All systems are now functioning correctly with robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.
